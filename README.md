# üçΩÔ∏è RestaurantApp ‚Äì Playwright MCP Automated Testing

A test automation project for validating login and logout flows in the [RestaurantAppAngular](https://github.com/pinakhonmode/AngularRestaurantApp) repository using **Playwright** and the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** with **Cursor AI**.

This project leverages Playwright to simulate real user behavior in a browser, and the MCP server enables Cursor (or Claude Desktop) to perform live interaction with your application.

---

## üîç What Was Tested

The following user journeys were tested using Cursor AI‚Äôs Playwright MCP server:

* ‚úÖ **Login Functionality** ‚Äì Verified valid user credentials allow access and redirect to the appropriate home/dashboard page.
* ‚úÖ **Logout Functionality** ‚Äì Confirmed user is properly logged out, session cleared, and redirected to the login page.
* ‚úÖ **Page Verification After Login/Logout** ‚Äì Ensured the correct UI elements and components are visible after login, and session pages are inaccessible post-logout.

## üé≠ What is Playwright?

[Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) is an end-to-end testing library by Microsoft that enables fast, reliable browser automation for Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit. It allows you to test modern web apps across various browsers and OS environments.

## üöÄ Playwright MCP Server Setup Guide

To run tests with **Claude Desktop** or **Cursor AI** using the **Playwright MCP Server**, follow the instructions below.

---

### üì¶ 1. Install Playwright MCP Server

**Official Package:** [`@executeautomation/playwright-mcp-server`](https://smithery.ai/server/@executeautomation/playwright-mcp-server)

You can install the server using any of the following methods:

#### ‚úÖ Using `npm`:

```bash
npm install -g @executeautomation/playwright-mcp-server
```

#### ‚úÖ Using `mcp-get`:

```bash
npx @michaellatman/mcp-get@latest install @executeautomation/playwright-mcp-server
```

#### ‚úÖ Using `Smithery` (recommended for Claude Desktop):

```bash
npx @smithery/cli install @executeautomation/playwright-mcp-server --client claude
```

---

### üíª 2. Install in VS Code

#### VS Code (Standard):

```bash
code --add-mcp '{"name":"playwright","command":"npx","args":["@executeautomation/playwright-mcp-server"]}'
```

#### VS Code Insiders:

```bash
code-insiders --add-mcp '{"name":"playwright","command":"npx","args":["@executeautomation/playwright-mcp-server"]}'
```

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è 3. Configuration for Claude Desktop

Add the following to your Claude Desktop configuration file:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "playwright": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@executeautomation/playwright-mcp-server"]
    }
  }
}
```

---

### ü§ñ 4. Configuration for Cursor AI

Add this to your **Cursor AI** configuration after the Claude block:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "playwright-mcp-server": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "@smithery/cli@latest",
        "run",
        "@executeautomation/playwright-mcp-server",
        "--key",
        "3a273e31-d5ad-421a-a0d9-33d18b5f8365",
        "--profile",
        "homeless-hornet-qyRXIq"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

---

### üí¨ Interact via Cursor AI

Use natural language prompts like:

* ‚ÄúTest login functionality with valid credentials‚Äù
* ‚ÄúCheck that the logout button works and redirects to login‚Äù

Cursor will automatically generate Playwright tests or execute instructions via MCP.

---

## ‚úÖ Test Status

| Test Case                         | Status |
| --------------------------------- | ------ |
| Login with valid credentials      | ‚úÖ Pass |
| Redirect after login              | ‚úÖ Pass |
| Logout button redirects correctly | ‚úÖ Pass |
| Prevent access after logout       | ‚úÖ Pass |
