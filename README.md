# üçΩÔ∏è RestaurantApp ‚Äì Playwright MCP Automated Testing

A test automation project for validating login and logout flows in the [RestaurantAppAngular]([https://github.com/pinakhonmode/AngularRestaurantApp]) repository using **Playwright** and the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** with **Cursor AI**.

This project leverages Playwright to simulate real user behavior in a browser, and the MCP server enables Cursor (or Claude Desktop) to perform live interaction with your application.

## üîç What Was Tested

The following user journeys were tested using Cursor AI‚Äôs Playwright MCP server:

* ‚úÖ **Login Functionality**
  Verified valid user credentials allow access and redirect to the appropriate home/dashboard page.

* ‚úÖ **Logout Functionality**
  Confirmed user is properly logged out, session cleared, and redirected to the login page.

* ‚úÖ **Page Verification After Login/Logout**
  Ensured the correct UI elements and components are visible after login, and session pages are inaccessible post-logout.

## üé≠ What is Playwright?

[Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) is an end-to-end testing library by Microsoft that enables fast, reliable browser automation for Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit. It allows you to test modern web apps across various browsers and OS environments.

## üì• Installation & Setup

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/pinakhonmode/RestaurantAppAngular

# Navigate into the repo
cd RestaurantAppAngular

# Run the App
ng serve -o
```

## üöÄ Running Playwright Tests via MCP Server

To run tests with Cursor AI or Claude Desktop using the Playwright MCP Server:

### 1. Install Playwright MCP Server

```bash
npx -y @executeautomation/playwright-mcp-server
```

### 2. Start the MCP Server

```bash
npx @executeautomation/playwright-mcp-server
```

This opens up a browser session which Cursor AI or Claude Desktop can connect to.

### 3. Interact via Cursor AI

Use natural language prompts like:

* *‚ÄúTest login functionality with valid credentials‚Äù*
* *‚ÄúCheck that the logout button works and redirects to login‚Äù*

Cursor will automatically generate Playwright tests or execute instructions via MCP.

## üì∏ Screenshots

Playwright automatically captures screenshots upon failure or step-wise:

# AngularProject

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 18.2.7.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI Overview and Command Reference](https://angular.dev/tools/cli) page.
